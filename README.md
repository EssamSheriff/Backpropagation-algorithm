# Backpropagation-algorithm
Implement the Back-Propagation learning algorithm on a multi-layer neural networks, which can be able to classify a stream 
of input data to one of a set of predefined classes.

Use the penguins data in both your training and testing processes. (Each class has 50 samples: train NN with the first 30 non-repeated samples, and test it with the remaining 20 samples)
